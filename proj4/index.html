        <p>
            We've built a cloth simulator that uses spring models and gravity to simulate a cloth falling, by itself and onto
            other objects and even onto itself. We've also leveraged shaders to easily texture the cloth, whether using
            diffuse shading or an environment mapped reflection. Some things we found interesting were:
            - how complex behavior emerges from these relatively simple spring models
            - how adjusting the 3 parameters we configured can drastically change the behavior of the cloth to simulate a huge
            range of materials

        To begin our cloth model, we create a grid of point masses connected by springs. We pin certain point masses to be
        fixed in place (such as two corners of the cloth) to allow for interesting behaviors when the rest of the cloth is
        subject to gravitaional and then spring forces. We create springs to model structural, shearing and bending
        constraints. The structural constraints maintain the basic form of the cloth, the bending constraints allow it to
        wrinkle and fold, and the shearing constraints allow the cloth to twist across diagonals. We can see this in the
        third picture, as the shearing constraints are from points to their diagonal neighbors.

        <h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>

        <!-- explanation of Q2 -->
        We simulate the cloth by computing the various forces on each point mass and using numerical integration to get the
        next position at each step. The forces consist of external forces like that from gravity, which are provided to the
        function, and spring forces, which we compute by using the Hooke's law equation for each spring. Sometimes the force
        on a point mass is very large and would result in an unreasonably large movement--to prevent this, we limit the
        length of the spring to be within 10% of the rest length. Finally, we add a damping term that scales down the
        velocity at each time step to simulate the loss of energy. This makes the simulation depends on three parameters:
        the spring
        constant, density of the point masses, and a damping factor. We'll discuss the effects of each of these below.

        <p>
            The larger the spring constant, the more stiff / resistant to movement a spring is. We can see that when the
            spring constant is low (2000), the spring is a lot less uniform, consisting of various folds. This simulates a
            more
            flimsy cloth. When the spring constant is higher (8000), the cloth appears a lot more rigid and rubber-like. For
            the most part, changes are constraint to the top part of the cloth and the rest of it isn't particularly stretched
            out.

            <p>
                In part, density has similar effects to the spring constant. The higher the density, the more resistant the
                spring is to change. However, greater density also comes with greater gravitational forces. This implies that at
                low densities, the spring force dominates and at high densities, the force of gravity dominates. In both cases,
                the cloth is flatter. In the case where there isn't one clearly dominant force, the cloth begins to reveal more
                complex folds because different point masses have different forces acting on them.

        </div>
        <!-- describe damping behavior-->
        <p>
            When there is no damping, the cloth has a complicated motion that oscillates back and forth repeatedly, as if
            there is a strong wind blowing on it. This is because when the cloth is losing no energy, there is no resistance
            to its motion that would slow it down. When damping is added, the motion of the cloth is a lot more controlled and
            it gradually settles into a stable position. In the 0.5 and 1 case in particular, the cloth moves very slowly down
            because the velocity is now severly limited.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling Collisions with other objects</h2>

        The previous part rendered the cloth on its own, but it can also interact with other objects in the scene. A neat
        example of this is the cloth falling on a sphere and wrapping around it (seen below). We implemented collisions with
        a sphere and a plane. We did this by figuring out when a cloth would have crossed over a plane / entered a sphere,
        and then moving the cloth back to the point at which it would have intesected the object. We also accounted for
        friction by moving the cloth a little bit farther than the intersection point.

            Above, we show the cloth resting on the sphere with various spring constants. With a low spring constant (ks=500),
            the
            cloth droops downward and stays closer to the sphere. With a high spring constant (ks=50000), it widens out and
            droops less
            down. As before, the higher spring constant is more resistant to change which is displayed by the lack of
            diversion from the original position (e.g. comparing to ks=5000 as a baseline). The lower spring constant is more
            influenced by the forces of gravity, hence the drooping.

            As the Ks value of the cloth increases, the rigidity of the cloth increases. More force is required to displace pointmasses from their
            original position, as the existing springs exert a greater force opposite to the displacement of gravity. In the 10,000 Ks cloth
            simulation, the cloth piles on in higher layers before eventually toppling to a resting state. Additionally, the rigidity of the cloth
            means that it does not unfold to the same degree of the 5000 ks cloth, so the higher spring constant cloth does not lie as flat as the lower
            spring constant cloth.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the density of the cloth increases, the number of pointmasses increase. This can be seen as the number of small folds / details increase
            in the cloth. In the initial state, the number of ripples are in the upper portion of the cloth is more noticable. As the cloth continually
            folds on itself and reaches a resting state, there is less convergence to a smooth surface as well. Instead the cloth is both more wrinkled
            and folded onto itself

        <h3 align="middle"> How shaders work </h3>
        <p>
            Within a rasterization pipeline shaders are delegated the work of determining how to color in fragments, which
            are essentially the pixels comprising the triangle. Given a set of inputs such as viewing direction and normals to the surface,
            the shader will compute the appropriate color as an output. Some shaders can also shaded based on inputs from a texture map,
            which does the work of determining where in the texture map to find a pixel value given some input vector. Shaders allow
            for a variety of colors / schemes such as loading directly from a texture map or doing various lighting calculations to find determine
            the brightness or pixel color.
        </p>
        <h3 align="middle"> In My Own Words: Blinn-Phong </h3>
        <p>
            The Blinn-Phong shading model determines how much light is reflected off of a surface. The shaders using the model determine the
            degree of light reflection of a pixel in order to find the brighntess of the pixel. There are 3 components to the Blinn-Phong model:
            specular, ambient, and diffuse reflection. In specular shading, light reflects off a surface based off it's angle with respect
            to the surface normal, so light will be reflected in the mirror direction (i.e the mirrored ray across the surface normal). This means
            that a viewing angle close to this mirror direction receives more light and will be brighter, so as the angle between
            the viewing angle and the mirror direction decreases the brightness is higher. Ambient shading refers to constant shading from the environment
            and this helps to color in shadows. Diffuse reflection refers to how light is distributed evenly when reflected off a surface and that
            as the angle between the surface normal and light increases, less overall light intersecting the surface and being reflected. Combining
            the lighting calculations from these results in the Blinn-Phong model.

            In bump mapping, the surface normal to the sphere is recalculated based off a height map. The change in height with respect to a step in
            the height map is found by incrementing the position in the height map by a small fraction of the overall texture size. The surface normal
            is found in object space and needs to be transformed back to normal space using the bitangent tangent normal matrix. The displacement
            mapping does the same normal transform, but also modifies the position of the point as well, so that it moves in the direction opposite
            to the surface normal. This is apparent, as the bump mapping is still a uniform sphere, just with the appearance of darkness like bumps.
            However, displacement mapping actually modifies the edges of the sphere such that light passes through the valleys / distortions of the sphere.
            It is no longer just a pattern on a sphere, but the sphere appears different.

        <p>
            As the resolution increase, the brighness of the Blinn-Phong specular shading increases. This makes sense, as the normals become more fine-grained
            or accurate, more light closer to the center will be reflected as these angles get smaller. More noticably for displacement shading, the course-grained
            resolution of -o 16 and -a 16 results in a "soccer" ball like shape where there are consistent displacements or indents along the sphere.
            This makes sense, as the normals to the mesh have a larger difference in angle / a single normal represents a larger portion of the mesh. This means
            that when a displacement in the shading occurs, it will occur for a larger section of the mesh and cause a greater visual displacement, since this
            one normal is associated with a larger section.
